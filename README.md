# LNG-Modeling
Forecasting on Natural Liquified Gas
The objective of the report is to do a modelling/forecasting analysis on a
financial time series ( LNG close price). My only constraint is that the series must have a
sufficiently long sample size. 
Apart from this constraint, the modeling needs to include a data analisys, an estimation of the
model parameters and a validation of the model (parameters and residuals)

To summurize, the main purpose of the model is to generate forecasts (log-returns and/or volatility) as well
as a confidence interval or the distribution of the forecasts (if possible).
